This guide covers how to send ngrok events into Datadog.
ngrok events can be used for amongst many other user cases; providing a history of changes within an account and per request visbility for active monitoring/troubleshooting and security traffic inspection.

By integrating ngrok with Datadog, you can:

- **Quickly identify application issues** in real-time using ngork request events in conjucntion with Datadog ml based monitoring.
- **Historically audit changes occurring within an account**.  Be able to historically audit changes within an account.
- **Profile usage of your service** by using Datadog queries and analytic charts.
- **Identify security issues** by using ngrok events and Datadog SIEM.


## **Step 1**: Obtain Datadog API Key {#obtain-datadog-api}

For ngrok to successfully send events into Datadog we'll require an API key. To either create or retrieve the API key, reference the following link [Datadog API documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#add-an-api-key-or-client-token). 


## **Step 2**: Create an Event Subscription {#create-event-subscription}

1. Using a browser, go to the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com) and navigate to <strong>Events</strong> on the left hand navigation and select <strong>Create Subscription</strong>.

Once complete, select <strong>Add Event Sources</strong> to confirm your selections.

## **Step 3**: Create Event Destination {#create-destination}

To send the events to Datadog we'll need to assign an Event Destination to the Event Subscription.

1. Within the Event Subscription configuration Destination Tab, select <strong>Add Destination.</strong>

1. Choose Datadog as the target and fill in the correct information being mindful of <strong>which region you Datadog data resides in</strong>.  Target, Region and API Key values are required, all other values are optional.

    - <strong>Service Name</strong> is a locally significant value and will be appended to the event destination name.<br></br>
    - <strong>DD Tags</strong> values will be added as tags to the event data being sent to be utilized within Datadog.
